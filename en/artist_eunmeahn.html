                Ah, the famous custard pie that is the confrontation "between tradition and modernity"... How many creators have struggled to find the way to describe what is finally the lot of every artist : one the one hand to know, understand, integrate what the ancients did; on the other to forgot them, overcome them and hope to find something new. Quite a vast program...
            </div>
            <div>
                On this level, Eun-Me Ahn has found new, unexpected and exciting ways. This first comes from her itinerary, marked as much by the learning and exploration of shamanistic tradition as by the many years spent in New York or a profound friendship with the missed Pina Bausch (who invited her many times in Wuppertal). Korean and cosmopolitan, figure of the avant-garde but also choreographer of the very official 2002 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Daegu and presented in the most important international festivals, she knows how to improve the beauties of contrast, mow polka dots, stripes and flower, how to play with the most pop colors before switching to the most solemn austerity, how to play with the most subtle shades of androgyny or une slowness to make trance rhythm burst... 
                Educated at the school of rigor, precise, demanding and of a all Korean discipline, Eun-Me Ahn is also a daredevil performer, ready for all kind of piracie s. One have seen her jump from the top of a crane to attack a piano with axe and scissors, rip off herself her fairy dress made of white ties to distribute the pieces to the audience while performing a teddybear dance, bury herself with a clown costumes under a rain of baloons, locked up behind bars in a duet with a chicken, or dressed up as a mushroom...  But one would be wrong thinking it is provocation. It is rather the affirmation of a curiosity and a freedom held by work and style pushed to their most unexpected limits. 
                <span>Eun-Me Ahn is associated artist of Théâtre de la Ville-Paris 2018-2019 season.</span>

                            Recently, the two Koreas have made a historical step on the path towards peace that could put an end to a 65 years old conflict. About North Korea, we know most of all its leader and its race to get nuclear weapon. But what about arts and dance in this country also know as "hermit country"?

                            In her country, Eun-Me Ahn is considered as one of the most important artsist of the choreographic landscape. Some also see in her a shaman of modern times.

                            Let's analyze it from the end :For « Dance », well... no need of translation. « Sim » can be translated in English by "mind" or state of mind". « Ahn » . it's the name of the choreographer, the name of a woman bursting with energy and joie de vivre who moves everything on her way : codes, conventions... and - above all - people. But "Ahn" also means "comfortable", "safe" in Korean.

                            Deamons in polka dot dresses, magician-healers on platform shoes, temple servants with pink rubber gloves or spirits floating in the air in their birthday suit...
