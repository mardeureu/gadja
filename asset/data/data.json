They dance until forgetting themselves in the movement to create together one unique body. They fade, blend into the group but yet, they are here with their personnality and they state it out loud and clear.",

At 20, body is changing fast. Mentalities too. It is an age where ideas - the one you inherit and the ones you build yourself - assert themselves to build a personality. Bringing together dancers from different countries, bringing together different bodies, my idea is to sketch a portrait of contemporary Asia and explore the dynamics running through dance practice in the region.",
